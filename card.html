				Siamese fighting fish usually grows to a length of about 6.5 cm (2.6 in).Although aquarium 
				specimens are widely known for their brilliant colours and large, flowing fins, the 
				natural coloration of B. splendens are generally dull green, brown and grey, and the 
				fins of wild specimens are short. In captivity, they have been selectively bred to display 
				a vibrant array of colours and tail types
